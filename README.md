# RockLeeTributePage
The following tribute page was created by Matthew Johnson.
It was created after following the freecodecamp web design
learning track. The purpose is to showcase introductory 
web design skills with purely HTML and CSS. 

The tribute page was chosen to be about Rock Lee because
Naruto is an awesome anime series and Rock Lee is one of
the best characters in the show.

The content isn't meant to be serious at all and is just
there to show off the web page styling.
